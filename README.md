> **[PoinTramba: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Framework for Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15463)**



> **Abstract.** 
> Point cloud analysis has seen substantial advancements due to deep learning, although previous Transformer-based methods excel at modeling long-range dependencies on this task, their computational demands are substantial. Conversely, the Mamba offers greater efficiency but shows limited potential compared with Transformer-based methods. In this study, we introduce PoinTramba, a pioneering hybrid framework that synergies the analytical power of Transformer with the remarkable computational efficiency of Mamba for enhanced point cloud analysis. Specifically, our approach first segments point clouds into groups, where the Transformer meticulously captures intricate intra-group dependencies and produces group embeddings, whose inter-group relationships will be simultaneously and adeptly captured by efficient Mamba architecture, ensuring comprehensive analysis. Unlike previous Mamba approaches, we introduce a bi-directional importance-aware ordering (BIO) strategy to tackle the challenges of random ordering effects. This innovative strategy intelligently reorders group embeddings based on their calculated importance scores, significantly enhancing Mamba's performance and optimizing the overall analytical process. Our framework achieves a superior balance between computational efficiency and analytical performance by seamlessly integrating these advanced techniques, marking a substantial leap forward in point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new state-of-the-art analysis benchmark on point cloud recognition. For the first time, this paradigm leverages the combined strengths of both Transformer and Mamba architectures, facilitating a new standard in the field.
